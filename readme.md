making a to-do application with very basic functionality using Django and MySQL database Xampp. you do not need to create any database tables just apply migrations.
This will create all the tables just make sure there is an existing database under the name of todo_django in xampp.
The todo tasks have only 4 fields: title, description, color and date. well hoping to increase the functionality on the go. 
you all can suggest some as well as link your own created project links.
